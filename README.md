# Digital-Media-Store----Analysis

The database holds datasets that includes information on artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

The aim of this project was to practise writing SQL querys to explore the database and answer questions.
For example:
 - Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
 - Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
 - Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID
and more...
